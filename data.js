We lost heroes, we made mistakes, but we still typically were able to manage and save the world. I know she and Cass had their arguments on method, but I was usually able to get those sorted. Saving the day was never enough for Alex. She and I would talk for hours about how to save the world, how to improve it. She and I recovered the mace on a mission in the middle east where it had been buried in an ancient underground temple. We brought it back to HQ to have it studied. I held the mace, but it never spoke to me. Alex had always been very intense, very straight laced, but after the mace, she was clearly different. Her worldview radicalised, and I think she stopped seeing everyone as worth saving. Our long conversations started to get longer and more heated. She classified me as among the people worth saving, which is why that mace I took to the ribs didn't kill me. She spared me. She didn't spare others, but it's clear that there's enough of her to still care about me. The mace had a hold on her long before she actually wielded it for the first time, and I'm inclined to think a similar quarantine is necessary to save her. I think she might've been my best friend, and I know I was hers. I fear with every passing day that it will mean less to her, because it doesn't mean less to me. We were close.

As the most powerful hero of today, if she were to ever fall rogue, she would be a tremendous issue. The real threat, however, is if she ever becomes convinced that WSPA is not acting with pure intentions. Perhaps the only thing more powerful than her abilities today is her reputation as a woman of extreme character and courage, and if she begins to speak on a topic, other heroes will absolutely listen. This is a potential threat.",
    quote:"\"TCK is the hero of today. Full stop. Everyone knows that.\nThe general public knows that Seraph is at an 8.2, The Anchor is at an 8.1, and so is TCK. The truth of the matter is a little different. We let our numbers get leaked from time to time. We over rank the Anchor and Seraph. When there’s a hero in the 8’s, everyone feels a little better. We’ve seen it several times. So we keep Seraph and the Anchor in the 8’s. TCK actually belongs in the 8’s, and is the only modern hero (excluding the alien), who's on par with Elegus and the Shamrocks. The world can’t know that. They need strong figures next to her, but for some reason two 7.9’s lead to increased levels of public fear, so we leave it at 8.1 and 8.2. Their current ratings are their golden age ratings. We elected not to change them despite believing they aren’t correct. TCK is the real deal.\nThere’s something else important about TCK that no one mentions. She knows she’s the real deal, and she knows the responsibilities that come with it. She practices wisdom, strength, and compassion for the world, but she has a private life that is much more curious, tender, and occasionally even immature. She knows that families rest easy because of her, and she takes that very seriously which is why she emphasizes being careful and heroic. The side that her family, her friends, and especially John see is very different. She’s not pretending, I think she just needs a place to recharge.\nShe also happens to be one of the largest threats to WSPA in the world if she wanted to be. When she speaks, everyone listens. Some will scoff, some will furrow a brow, and many will answer her call. If she ever decided that WSPA was not an ethical organization, it would be extremely uncharacteristic of her to sit idly by.

TCK is the key, for better or worse.",
    quote:"\"The way he talks, you would be forgiven for thinking he’s joking. We thought so too. I remember when Ali and I pulled him in for a meeting. He didn’t mind, he was very polite. Ali asked John to explain why he was on Earth. John responded that he has been protecting sentient and non sentient life for as long as he can remember. We tried to guess how long that might be, and he just shrugged his shoulders. He was so happy to chat with us, it’s a type of simplistic joy that you tend to see on the superheroes who are just happy to be in the game. You know that old saying, the winner is happy they won but afraid of the pressure, second place is sad they lost, bronze is just happy to be on the podium. That’s what I thought we were dealing with. He volunteered to be The Anchors practice dummy. No scratch. Then we watched him take on six massive threats in a single week. No scratch. After the sixth, he flew into space and we watched him disappear with a speed we can’t measure. By then I knew I was wrong about him. He’s a cosmic being. You can trust that everything he says he does, he’s doing, or rather, he’s probably drastically underselling it. He’s aware that what he’s doing is terrifying for us, so generally, he’s trying to minimize it. Our rating capped out at a logarithmic 9.9 because he redefined our scale. He has told us that he’s fought beings more powerful than him, but then again, he won…\" — George Nichols",

The average civilian will remember Hughes, Elegus, or Styles. But I'll never forget The Iron Legend. He passed away only recently. I know the golden age was from the 40's to the 80's, the silver from the 80's to the 2020's, but I felt like he would be there forever. Most of the silver age squad never got the chance to meet him, he'd long since pivoted to full time legal work. It's where he could do the most good. He redeemed a lot of supervillains. The last time I talked to him was a month after he retired. He was in his 90's. The last of the Golden age heroes. He'd painted two portraits of him with the rest of the golden age heroes. I was hoping he'd give one to WSPA, but he, in all his wisdom, gave them to Seraph and The Anchor. It was the happiest I'd seen Solomon in my life. Seraph as well. Enough to make a grown man cry.\" - Director Abbas Ali"};
